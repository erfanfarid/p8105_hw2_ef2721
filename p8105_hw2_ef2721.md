## Problem 1

Below we import and clean data from
`NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv`. First data is imported,
then the `Route` column names that are not `dbl` are turned into `chr`.
We then use janitor function, select the noted columns, and change
`entry` from `yes` / `no` to a logical variable.

``` r
trans_df = 
  read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
  col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(
    line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, 
    starts_with("route"), entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, 
    ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

The presentation is not yet “tidy”: route number should be a variable,
as should route. That is, to obtain a tidy dataset we would need to
convert `route` variables from wide to long format. This will be useful
when focusing on specific routes, but may not be necessary when
considering questions that focus on station-level variables.

The following code chunk selects station name and line, and then uses
`distinct()` to obtain all unique combinations. As a result, the number
of rows in this dataset is the number of unique stations.

``` r
trans_df %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
## # A tibble: 465 × 2
##    station_name             line    
##    <chr>                    <chr>   
##  1 25th St                  4 Avenue
##  2 36th St                  4 Avenue
##  3 45th St                  4 Avenue
##  4 53rd St                  4 Avenue
##  5 59th St                  4 Avenue
##  6 77th St                  4 Avenue
##  7 86th St                  4 Avenue
##  8 95th St                  4 Avenue
##  9 9th St                   4 Avenue
## 10 Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr 4 Avenue
## # … with 455 more rows
## # ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows
```

There are 465 unique stations based on the code chunk above.

To identify unique stations that are `ada` complaints, we first filter
the data from ada that are `TRUE`. Then, similar to above, we select
based on station name and line. Below is the code chunk explanation.

``` r
trans_df %>% 
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
## # A tibble: 84 × 2
##    station_name                   line           
##    <chr>                          <chr>          
##  1 Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr       4 Avenue       
##  2 DeKalb Av                      4 Avenue       
##  3 Pacific St                     4 Avenue       
##  4 Grand Central                  42nd St Shuttle
##  5 34th St                        6 Avenue       
##  6 47-50th Sts Rockefeller Center 6 Avenue       
##  7 Church Av                      6 Avenue       
##  8 21st St                        63rd Street    
##  9 Lexington Av                   63rd Street    
## 10 Roosevelt Island               63rd Street    
## # … with 74 more rows
## # ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows
```

There are 84 compliant stations.

For the next sub-question, we first filter the stations with no vending
machine. We then see how many stations from that subset allow entry to
be possible. Mean is proportion here since entry is a logical variable.

``` r
trans_df %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO") %>% 
  pull(entry) %>% 
  mean
## [1] 0.3770492
```

the proportion desired was 0.38.

We use the `pivot_longer` function to reformat the data to add route
number and route name as distinct variables. Subsequently, we use the
`filter` function to narrow down which stations service A line, and of
those which are ADA compliant, respectively. The code chunk below
addresses that

``` r
trans_df %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_num",
    values_to = "route") %>% 
  filter(route == "A") %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
## # A tibble: 60 × 2
##    station_name                  line           
##    <chr>                         <chr>          
##  1 Times Square                  42nd St Shuttle
##  2 125th St                      8 Avenue       
##  3 145th St                      8 Avenue       
##  4 14th St                       8 Avenue       
##  5 168th St - Washington Heights 8 Avenue       
##  6 175th St                      8 Avenue       
##  7 181st St                      8 Avenue       
##  8 190th St                      8 Avenue       
##  9 34th St                       8 Avenue       
## 10 42nd St                       8 Avenue       
## # … with 50 more rows
## # ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows
```

There are 60 distinct stations that serve the A line
